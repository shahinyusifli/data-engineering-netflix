 I've developed a data engineering solution for Inbank's take-home task. I designed normalized data model for efficient data warehousing. In addition, I created ETL pipelines using Airflow to handle data flow into a PostgreSQL data warehouse. Furthermore, I formulated and executed SQL queries to fulfill the specific reporting requirements.
